Overview/description of the project: I am utilizing a Giphy Search Engine with an API to enable a user to enter 
and submit a keyword that then responds with images from that type of keyword. 

Details on how to use it or what functionality is offered: 
A keyword (e.g. funny cat) can generate GIF's of that specific word. 

Technologies Used ( .html , .css ): HTML, CSS and Javascript

Ideas for future improvement (minimum of 3)
1. Larger population of images for users to look for

2. Have the images in rows and columns rather than having aside bar

3. Creating a random section that will pop up as the user opens the website
